## QuickBuild
Allow to build and start multiple instances. Useful for network tests.

## Getting started
* Open QuickBuild window (Window > QuickBuild).
* Create new QBProfile (Project window > Create > QuickBuild/Profile).
* Set your QBProfile into the QuickBuild window.
* You can edit your QBProfile from the QuickBuild window or directly from the asset.
* Press "Build & Start current scenes"
* Enjoy!

## Profile use
The profiles allow you to quickly switch your settings when you want to try several configurations one after another.

## Custom Instance Data
You can create new QBInstanceData via Project window > Create > QuickBuild/Custom Instance Data.
With custom instance data, you can set specific settings for each of your started instance.
If you have 3 instances started and you want the last one to have specific settings :
* Foldout Advanced Settings
* Foldout Expert Settings
* Foldout Custom Instance Datas
* Set your size to 3
* Bind you QBInstanceData to the last slot (you can let the 2 others empty, it won't be an issue)
